    <h2>Adam Nielsen</h2>
    <p>My name is Adam Nielsen. I am studying Software Development online. </p>
    <p>I am from Idaho Falls, Idaho. I have been married for 6 years, we have one son and we are expecting a daughter in June.</p>
    <p>I enjoy being active through outdoor activities with my family and friends and am always working on my fitness.</p>
    <p>I am currently serving in the Utah Air National Guard full time.</p>
    <p>I chose my major becuase it allows me to try both web development and programming to see what I might prefer pursuing in a career.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture currently is Ether 8:26 "Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away, 
        and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men,</p>
    <p> but that they may be persuaded to do good continually, 
        that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved."</p>
